Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire premiered at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on March 25, 2024, and was released in the United States on March 29. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $194 million worldwide, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2024.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire[a] is a 2024 American monster film directed by Adam Wingard. Produced by Legendary Pictures, it is a sequel to Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), and the fifth film in the MonsterVerse franchise. It is also the 38th film of the Godzilla franchise and the 13th film in the King Kong franchise.

Between Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong, it felt like Legendary Pictures had worked out a solid plan to launch its interconnected Monsterverse of films into the stratosphere. By going big on spectacle and bringing so many of Toho’s classic kaiju together, the Monsterverse films captured the spirit of the Shōwa era.

They stayed “true” to the franchise in a way that made them sit comfortably alongside Japanese films like Godzilla Minus One. But that same approach is also why director Adam Wingard’s Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire feature often feels like it’s hopped up on way too much of a good thing.

The film stars Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Dan Stevens, Kaylee Hottle, Alex Ferns, and Fala Chen. Hall, Henry, and Hottle reprise their roles from the previous film. In the film, Kong encounters more of his species in the Hollow Earth and must unite with Godzilla to stop their tyrannical leader and a powerful, frost breathing Titan from destroying the surface.

After years of Godzilla being generally seen as a terrifying threat, The New Empire opens at a point when the radioactive amphibian has become something of an unruly hero to people across the globe. In one of The New Empire’s first set pieces, the big man causes just as much destruction as his enemy as he chomps, punches, and tail whips the other kaiju to death while untold numbers of people die in the crossfire.

But with the memory of King Ghidorah, Rodan, and Mechagodzilla still relatively fresh in people’s minds, they’re willing to accept that Godzilla belongs on the planet’s surface to keep other Titans down in the Hollow Earth — the mysterious realm where giant apes like Kong originated.

The giant Gorilla, aka King Kong and Godzilla, is a dinosaur-like monster, and the duo has entertained the viewers for years. The excitement doubles when the Titans appear in the same movies, and their universe is known as the MonsterVerse. The latest release in the franchise is Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. These movies rely heavily on CGI to create screen monsters, requiring a hefty budget. Reportedly, the recent film has the lowest budget; find out which MonsterVerse movie is the costliest.

“Godzilla vs. Kong” filmmaker Adam Wingard returned to direct “The New Empire,” starring Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens. Unlike prior iterations, which pit the creatures against each other, this film sees Kong unite with Godzilla to stop a mysterious threat from destroying the planet. It carries a $135 million production budget, so outsized global ticket sales will be necessary to justify its mighty price tag. With this momentum, though, “The New Empire” is primed to eventually surpass its predecessor, 2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong.” Heading into the weekend, the monster mashup was projected to earn $50 million to $55 million to start.

But “Godzilla x Kong,” which sees the two otherworldly beasts team up to save the planet, trounced those projections after benefitting from several factors, including premium large formats (accounting for 48% of ticket sales) and audience enthusiasm (it landed an “A-” CinemaScore”). Critics were less impressed by “The New Empire,” starring Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens and directed by Adam Wingard (“Godzilla vs. Kong”). It holds a 55% “rotten” average on Rotten Tomatoes.
